This is a Python implementation of Gina Trapani's Todo.txt Bash script, which you can find at https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/downloads

It's still very alpha-level with only the most basic features.

USAGE: python todo.py <action> <text>

<action> can be either 'add' , 'done' or 'list'

<text> need not be provided as an argument. If it is skipped, the program will prompt the user for the appropriate input
